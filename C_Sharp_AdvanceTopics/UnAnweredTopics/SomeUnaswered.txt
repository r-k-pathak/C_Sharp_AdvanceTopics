Hi , I am going add here some of the points for my memories so i will not miss these.
These are the topic which as pe my perspective need more time to dive deeper into the detail,
I will surely cover these topics but for now ,i don't want to stop my concept series because of these.

1)Doamin Accessiblity in C#
2)Memory allocation from Stack and Heap perspective, for Struct with and without new key.
(Done some RND on this but there are some theories which makes me little confuses,I will come up with complete depth)
3)Gloal Allias for our own written class,Is it allowed in C#? if yes then how, if no then how we are able to Use string alias of String Class.
(This is a stackoverflow question which is not asnwered yet)

4) More expalnation on Boxing and Unboxing.
